# CountOnMe
The idea is to have a whatsapp help number which can take help requests from users in danger. It can trigger an SOS call to users's near and dear ones or trusted people and request them for help. A person has to initially register one or more people as their trusted help buddy whom they would like help message to be sent. After registering whenever in need , the person can just type "Help" on the whatsapp number and automatically SOS help message would be sent to their trusted people or concerned authorities.  Idea of having whatsapp as user interface is , it is already present in phone's of majority of people so accessing the "CountOnMe" features would be seamless.
